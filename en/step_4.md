## Adding an obstacle

Having obstacles to avoid will make your game more challenging, and making them appear at bottom of the screen and travel upwards will create a sense of movement.

Choose a sprite from the library that will serve as an obstacle â€” it can be anything you think might be found on a ski slope. Add this new sprite.

You now need to add code to the sprite to make it move:

1. `Go to`{:class="blockmotion"} the bottom of the slope and `show`{:class="blocklooks"}
1. `Glide`{:class="blockmotion"} up the screen
1. `Hide`{:class="blocklooks"} when it reaches the top
1. `Wait for 1 second`{:class="blockcontrol"} and then repeat

```blocks
    when green flag clicked
    forever 
        go to x: (0) y: (-180)
        show
        glide (1) secs to x: (0) y: (180)
        hide
        wait (1) secs
    end
```

## Challenge: change the obstacle's costume

Can you make the obstacle's costume change each time it appears? 

If the sprite you have chosen has only have one costume, you could choose a costume from the library, use another sprite or create your own second costume for the one you already have.

Add the `next costume`{:class="blocklooks"} block before the `show`{:class="blocklooks"}.

```blocks
    next costume
    show
```
